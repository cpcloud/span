Python module to read Tucker-Davis Technologies TTank files

Dependencies
---
* [Python](http://python.org) >= 3
* [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org) >= 1.6
* [SciPy](http://scipy.org) >= 0.10
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) >= 0.8.1
* [Nose](http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest) >= 1.1.3 if you want to run tests

Purpose
---
I need to read large files quickly into numpy arrays and do all sorts
of analysis, thus I created this package to help me do that.

Currently, it's very "hacky" and thus the API is very unstable. I
wholeheartedly welcome any contributions!
